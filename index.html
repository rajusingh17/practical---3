    <h2> About the course</h2>
    <p>
        Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript portion of website production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.
        </p>

    <p> Back-end Development refers to the server side of development where you are primarily focused on how the site works. This type of web development usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser.
